a) a c++ wrapper for the package incase people don't have 
swig or python installed. (urgent, since I don't have it on big cluster,let's 
wait till tomorrow to see if this works on the new system)
b) documentation (urgent, since I will forgot what to do later)
c) output for phasefit class (Mostly done, although the python 2d part is 
still buggy)
d) uneven bins for phasefit class (not urgent)
e) better statistic for fitmap (probably not urgent)
f) output more useful information for fitmap, for example, a shifted cmap 
instead of the model (can hack to do that, but need improvement, the urgent 
information should be the chisquare and the shifting sequence which help to 
reproduce the map)
#Done g) python flag (Urgent, related to the wrapper part)
h) get rid of the transits that doesn't contain information (meaning 
containing too many zeros if user require) (not urgent, might need more 
discussion with G)
